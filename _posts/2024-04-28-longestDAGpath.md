Finding the longest path in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a classic problem in computer science. The problem is interesting because it can be solved in linear time, which is not the case for general graphs. 

A directed acyclic graph is a directed graph with no cycles. This means that there is no way to start at a node and follow a sequence of edges to return to the same node. Finding the longest path in this kind of graph can find applications in many areas, such as project management, scheduling, and network routing.
