        <!-- Hello! My name's Esteban Charry and I'm a student working on software development and data science. I've been
        interested in software and computers since I was a kid, and got even more into it in high school. Today I attend
        classes at UC Berkeley, where I'm studying to obtain my degree in a related field. -->
        <br>
        Welcome to my software development portfolio! <br><br>
            

        I'm a data science student with a passion for creating innovative and efficient software solutions. I have a strong background in computer science, having taken a variety of courses providing me with a solid foundation in computer science concepts as well as practical skills in programming, algorithm design, and data structures.
        <br><br>
        I'm particularly interested in the design and analysis of algorithms as well as their applications leveraging data. My experience in software development has been greatly enhanced by my education and I am always looking for new ways to apply my skills to different problems. I'm excited to bring my skills and knowledge to a new settings and if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential opportunities, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
        <br><br>
        Some relevant courses I've taken at UC Berkeley include:
        <ul>
            <li>CS 61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</li>
            <li>CS 61B: Data Structures</li>
            <li>CS 70: Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory</li>
            <li>Data 8: Foundations of Data Science</li>
            <li>Data 100: Principles and Techniques of Data Science</li>
            <li>Math 1B: Calculus II</li>
            <li>EECS 16A, B: Designing Information Devices and Systems I and II</li>
            <li>EECS 126: Probability and Random Processes</li>
        </ul>
        I've also taken courses at local community colleges, including:
        <ul>
            <li>Norco College's
                <ul>
                    <li>MAT-1A: Calculus I</li>
                    <li>MAT-12: Statistics</li>
                    <li>CIS-66: Web Development I</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>MiraCosta College's Math 260: Calculus and Analytic Geometry III</li>
        </ul>
        And many more planned!
